### Week of 11/1 - 11/8:
- This week, we decided to be groupmates and wrote our team contract and initial project proposal. We met on Sunday 11/7 and chose a dataset and algorithms that would answer interesting questions. We decided on a dataset of roads in Texas, and a BFS traversal, Prim's algorithm, and Betweenness Centrality.

### Week of 11/9 - 11/15:
- Our initial proposal was not thorough enough, so we spent this week revising the proposal. We noticed that our dataset did not have weights, so we found a new dataset that was very similar, but with weights. We researched the algorithms on our own and met on 11/11 to work on revise the proposal.

### Week of 11/16 - 11/22:
- This week we were very busy with midterms and assignments for other classes, so we were not able to meet.

### Week of 11/23 - 11/29:
- During the beginning of Fall Break, we decided that each of us would research one of the algorithms that we would be writing. Andrew researched the data parsing, Joey did the BFS, Connor researched Prim's Algorithm, and Nick did Dijkstra's algorithm and Betweenness Centrality. After break, we all got together Sunday, and spent the night combining our research and writing the algorithms together. 

### Week of 11/30 - 12/6
- We all individually researched makefiles and how to compile our code during the beginning of the week. We met during the day of 12/2 and finished the makefiles and planned out the rest of our project timeline. We met again on 12/6 and debugged our implementation of Prim's algorithm. Next, we wrote Dijkstra's algorithm and implemented Betweenness Centrality. We plan to meet again this coming week to write test cases to make sure that our code works in every circumstance, and begin planning our presentation of the project.

### Week of 12/7 - 12/13
- We met on 12/8 to finish writing tests on the algorithms. Additionally, we began working the slides that we'll use for the final presentation and our README. We also wrote our main.cpp to interact with command line inputs so that our code can be run more modularly on varying datasets. We also wrote code to write the results to a file instead of printing.
