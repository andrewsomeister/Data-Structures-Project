Prim's Algorithm:
This is the set of edges that make up the minimum spanning tree.
1 <-> 0
2 <-> 1
3 <-> 6
4 <-> 2
5 <-> 1
6 <-> 4
7 <-> 5
8 <-> 6
9 <-> 8

Betweenness Centrality:
The following are the amount of times each node is appears in a shortest path. A higher score indicates a more central node.

The most central node is node 4 with a score of 36.

Node 0: 9
Node 1: 25
Node 2: 32
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 36
Node 5: 13
Node 6: 30
Node 7: 13
Node 8: 28
Node 9: 9

Breadth First Search:
