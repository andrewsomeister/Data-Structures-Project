# Team Contract

## Communication

### Team Meetings:
- We will meet in person Sundays and Wednesdays from 7 to 9:30 pm. We will rotate the note-taker for each week, with notes being taken on a shared google drive folder. The note taker is responsible for writing notable ideas and problems, and writing the work distribution for the week.

### Assistance:
- We will contact each other through texting and calling as necessary. We expect each other to respond within 3-4 hours.

### Respect:
- Group decisions will be made by majority, with three members needed in favor to approve. When a decision needs to be made, we will all write down our ideas and present them to each other, with conversation and a vote following. See Conflict Resolution below for the plan in case of a conflict.


## Collaboration

### Work Distribution
- Each week, we will decide on the goals of the group. The necessary tasks to accomplish that goal will next be identified. We will each volunteer for the assignments that we will accomplish. Once no more tasks are available, we will review the difficulty and time needed for each to ensure that no group member will be working signicantly more or less than the others.

### Time Commitment
- Each team member is expected to work between 2 and 7 hours per week on the project. If this commitment is not able to be met in a specific circumstance, another team member will step in to help out when another member is not able to work enough, or will have to work too much. The team understands that to finish this final project well, we will need to step in for each other every once in a while.

### Conflict Resolution
- In the event that there is a conflict within the team, we will play an all-in poker hand. The winner of the hand will decide who was right.
